   ## Continuous integration

   Automatically build and test the software on a regular basis(daily builds, per-commit builds).

</section>

<section style="text-align: left;" data-markdown>
    ## Continuous delivery

    Next step after CI. You trust your build process and tests to provide guarantee of quality. More of a philosophy/commitment to ensure that the code is always release-ready.

    ## Continuous deployment

    Next step after CI/CD(1). Delivering features/fixes to the customer as soon as they're ready.

        ### Team culture

        * Get everyone involved (Devs, DBAs, Managers)
        * Outline the investment everyone needs to make and what will they get out of it

    </section>

    <section style="text-align: left;" data-markdown>
        ### Environments
        * Get a good environment separation
            + Dedicated *dev* environments.
            + Dedicated staging environment(s) identical to production for testing the builds.
        * Dedicated build environment where all integration takes place.
    </section>

    <section style="text-align: left;" data-markdown>
        ### Deployment process

        * Automated build integrity-checks
    </section>

    <section style="text-align: left;" data-markdown>
        ### Rollback/recovery process

        * Immediate restore from backup
        * Pre-tested rollback versions(prev-master)
        * Fallback environments
            + Previous version stored until current deploy status turns green

    </section>
    <section style="text-align: left;" data-markdown>
        ### Development practices

        * Most difficult to tackle
            + Personal preferences/practices involved
        * Modular commits
        * Automated code validation(linting)
        * Automated testing
        * Peer review

    ## Steps towards CI

    * Use an issue tracker for everything
    * Create a separate branch for the work done, tagged with the issue number
    * Develop on the branch, and continuously test and integrate it
    * Optional: Push your changes to a rush box(dev box)
    * When ready, create a pull request for the branch
    * Merge and release
        + Deploy to staging
        + Promote to production
